My partner and I complete an analysis of the mashable.com data and the number of shares a post receives. We analyzed the data through OLS, Poisson regression, random forests and
boosted trees. We found that depending on the channel (social media, entertainment, lifestyle, business, world and technology) a different model performed best. 
If we were to do this project again, I would have chosen to analyze the models rather than complete the automation part. I felt like the automation was useful to do, but I missed 
out on drawing the big conclusions because I did not do the final analysis and model decision.
The most difficult part for me was understanding how to get the different pages for the different channel. My partner was extremely helpful for that.
I have one big takeaway. That is that I need some serious support with github and github pages because every time I need to work with it I struggle.
