My initial post about a data scientist vs. statistician was very much based in what I read online about the difference between the two. After this class, I believe there isn't 
much of a difference between them. Once upon a time there may have been a difference between the two, but as technology has evolved, statisticians do most of their work 
on computers, using programming languages, as do data scientists. I still believe one thing from the initial post-that in general the difference has to do with general vs.
specific training. 

I love R. I never realized how useful it could be until this class. I feel very comfortable using it at this point and will continue to use it going forward. I believe I am at
the place in my understanding where I can do most basic things and have the knowledge to do enough research to do more complicated things. Things like Project3 (the final exam)
are a little over my head, but for my professional use I do not need to do anything that complicated. I have already brought R in to my profession where it wasn't being used before.
It is a quick and easy way to do EDA and analysis as well as create professional looking reports.

The main thing that this course has changed for me is my ability to use the internet to help me figure out how to do things in R. I don't think I had the know-how prior to this 
course to understand those help forms. Now I feel like I can use R for just about anything I want to, as long as I have google and enough time on my hands.
