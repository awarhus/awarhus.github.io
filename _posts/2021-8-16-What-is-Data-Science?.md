Data science is applications of statistics. Where a statistician can determine the correct distribution to model the data at hand an perform analysis to answer questions, a data
scientist can use the data to answer questions that you already have. A statistician can probably answer the same questions without drawing conclusions specific to any particular 
field. While a statistician receives training in concepts and mathematical derivations of statistical formulas, a data scientist receives training in computer programming. Again,
that is not to say that statisticians cannot program and data scientists cannot derive formulas, but there is less mastery of each skill respectively. In short, from reading the 
articles I believe that a statistician is a generalist who can apply their knowledge to many fields and draw general conclusions and a data scientist is a specifist
who has specific knowledge about one field and can apply their knowledge (with the help of computer programming) to draw specific questions within that field.

I see myself trained as a statistician, but it seems that most companies are looking for data scientists instead. Therefore, I see myself working as a data scientist. I am taking 
my training and experience in education and combining it with my training in statistics, throwing in a dash of computer programming (often supported my frantic google 
searches for support) and producing data driven methods to improve secondary math education.
