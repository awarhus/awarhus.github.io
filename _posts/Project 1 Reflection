Project 1 Overview
In project 1 I pulled from the COVID API and investigated the data. I was interested in looking at COVID because it is something I felt I had a good background in, so the data would 
be understandable and something that could provide me with interesting data. After writing functions to contact every part of the API, I did some exploratory data analysis centered
around death rates due to COVID19. I began by just looking at death rates and then narrowed my focus to just the Americas and ended at just the upper midwest, which is where I live.

I found that Brazil and the US have unusually high numbers of COVID19 rates compared to other countries in the US. If I were researching this more, I would try to find out why
this is. Is there more testing in these countries? Is transmission higher in these countries; and if it is, why? Is it related to population size? After narrowing my focus to the upper
midwest, I found that Illinois has the highest death rate from COVID19 of all of the states in this region. I am interested to know why this is. Wisconsin is one of lower death rates,
but not the lowest. I find it fascinating that two states that are right next to each other can have such drastically different outcomes.

Reflection on Difficult Aspects
I don't really struggle with logic and programming in R in general. There are small things that I struggle with, but nothing major. For example, when I was coding my USA_by_Type function,
I couldn't (and still can't) figure out how to filter my dataset to include only a specified Province. I used the same code structure and syntax as other functions where I successfully
filtered the data, but this time it didn't work. I probably spent about 4 hours just on this. I still don't understand why R wouldn't filter the results for me.

Besides that type of struggle, my biggest struggle in this project was figuring out aspects of contacting APIs and committing to Github that I didn't previously understand. 
It took me about a week to figure out what it means to contact different parts of an API and how I could do that in R. That was because I didn't fully understand what an API was 
prior to this project. While frustrating, this project helped me uncover and learn objectives that I had previously not fully understood. 

I don't think I would approach this project any differently than I did. After I processed what I was supposed to do, I wrote down my own directions for myself on a piece of paper. 
Next, I focused on contacting endpoints of the API and made sure I got the correct data. Then I added to my handwritten notes a list of things I would like to be able to do for EDA 
(i.e. barplot of deathrates for upper midwestern states) and coded to get that particular item. This process created a running shell of what I wanted. From there I fancied my code up.
I added user customizations for the functions, I made my graphs look nicer, etc. Finally, I wrote in trends that I saw in the graphs and formatted my code. This is the process that
I always use when coding and it works well for me. I like to get the basics out of the way first and worry about the details later.
