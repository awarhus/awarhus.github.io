## Programming Background Blog Post

I prefer R over all other programs I have learned. I find it significantly more intuitive and less convoluted than other programs. I like that R is open source, so there are a lot of different packages to help you achieve whatever it is you are trying to do. I also like how much documentation there is available about those packages online.
I don't miss anything about other languages. I do like like programming except in R. I do not consider R difficult to learn at all. At worst it is tedious, but never difficult. 

## Example R Markdown Output

```{r}
plot(mtcars)
